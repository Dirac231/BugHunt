## What is this?

In my experience 403 bypasses are not tested thoroughly enough, this function will perform a number of checks to aid you with their exploitation

## How to use?

Simply call the function against the 403 endpoint:
```bash
bypass [URL/PATH]
```
you will also have to download the wordlist in the repository and reference their path correctly in the function before usage.
